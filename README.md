### Fibonoccie Calculator
---
This Java-based project consists of a Java Server and a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI).
The client sends a request to the server with the data entered by the user. The server then calculates
the value of the Fibonacci sequence and returns that value. The data received is displayed on the GUI.
